== INSTALLATION ==

To use this project:

    > cd $HOME
    > git clone https://github.com/ingydotnet/....git
    > .../... conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opticpow/optic-dots/master/conf
    > .../... upgrade
    > .../... install

== CONFIGURATION ==

When you configure a new machine, most of the settings are common to all your machines. Some are machine specific and some are user specific. To make these files work for all situations, DotDotDot uses the $USER and $LOCAL environment variables. For instance, say you are setting up a Macbook. Your `.bashrc` file would source these files:

    .bashrc-common                      # Your common settings
    .bashrc-local                       # export $LOCAL to 'macbook'
    .bashrc-$LOCAL                      # Your macbook settings
    .bashrc-$USER                       # Your personal settings

You should create your own, one-line `.bashrc-local` file that contains:

    export LOCAL=macbook

== DISCLAIMER ==

Unix config files have always been very adhoc, and personal. This is finally an attempt to make them simple, sharable and managable.

That said, this project is very grass roots, and based on my own personal settings. I use Bash and Vim. Maybe you use Zsh and Emacs. Everything here is fairly straightforward, but make sure you know what you are getting into before you try this.

With a little bit of smarts, we can work together to make everyone happy.
